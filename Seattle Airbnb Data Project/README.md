🧹 **Project Summary**
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline—from raw data ingestion to dashboard visualization—using Airbnb property data from Seattle. It simulates what a data analyst or business analyst might do to prepare market insights for stakeholders interested in short-term rental investments or business strategy.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**
MySQL – Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation (CTEs, CASE, string functions)

Excel – Initial deduplication, formatting, and NULL handling

Tableau – Building interactive dashboards and visualizing key metrics

Git/GitHub – For version control, documentation, and portfolio hosting

📌 **Project Workflow**
Imported raw dataset using LOAD DATA INFILE in MySQL (56,000+ records)

Cleaned and structured the data:

Split address fields using SUBSTRING_INDEX, LOCATE, and LEFT

Replaced nulls and blanks using IFNULL, NULLIF, and Excel preprocessing

Removed duplicates using ROW_NUMBER() inside CTEs

Converted Y/N flags into “Yes”/“No”

Created bins for pricing and value tiers using CASE logic

Filtered out unused or irrelevant columns post-transformation

Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) in Tableau:

Room types and occupancy trends

Distribution of property types

Most expensive ZIP codes

Monthly rental profitability seasonality

Security deposit and cleaning fee averages

📈 **Key Findings**
Average Guests (Accommodates): 1.68

Average Security Deposit: $287.09

Average Cleaning Fee: $62.37

Most Expensive ZIP Codes: 98134, 98119, 98101

Peak Rental Season: Late May through the winter holidays

Most Common Listing: Individual bedrooms (not entire properties) dominate due to high demand and affordability in the Seattle market

💡 **Use Case:**

For Prospective Airbnb Hosts in Seattle
This dataset and dashboard can provide valuable market insights for:

Individuals or companies looking to start an Airbnb in the Seattle area

Understanding where and when to list a property for maximum profitability

Identifying the optimal room type to list (e.g., private rooms vs. full homes)

Pricing strategy based on ZIP code, accommodations, and seasonal demand

Budgeting for security deposits and cleaning fees

Based on seasonal trends, many hosts may choose to live in their property off-season and rent it out during peak periods (May–December).

📤 **Outcome**
This end-to-end project demonstrates real-world business analytics skills in:

Data wrangling (ETL)

SQL transformation logic

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data storytelling and dashboard design

It prepares the dataset for use in stakeholder presentations, business intelligence tools, or integration into predictive models and Airbnb profitability calculators.
