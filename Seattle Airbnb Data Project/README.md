🧹 **Project Summary**
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline—from raw data ingestion to dashboard visualization—using Airbnb property data from Seattle. It simulates what a data analyst or business analyst might do to prepare market insights for stakeholders interested in short-term rental investments or business strategy.

🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**

Excel – Initial deduplication, formatting, and NULL handling

Git/GitHub – For version control, documentation, and portfolio hosting

📌 **Project Workflow**

Replaced nulls and blanks using IFNULL, NULLIF, and Excel preprocessing

Filtered out unused or irrelevant columns post-transformation

Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) in Tableau

📈 **Key Findings**
Average Guests (Accommodates): 1.68

Average Security Deposit: $287.09

Average Cleaning Fee: $62.37

Most Expensive ZIP Codes: 98134, 98119, 98101

Peak Rental Season: Late May through the winter holidays

Most Common Listing: Individual bedrooms (not entire properties) dominate due to high demand and affordability in the Seattle market

💡 **Use Case:**

For Prospective Airbnb Hosts in Seattle
This dataset and dashboard can provide valuable market insights for:

Individuals or companies looking to start an Airbnb in the Seattle area

Understanding where and when to list a property for maximum profitability

Identifying the optimal room type to list (e.g., private rooms vs. full homes)

Pricing strategy based on ZIP code, accommodations, and seasonal demand

Budgeting for security deposits and cleaning fees

Based on seasonal trends, many hosts may choose to live in their property off-season and rent it out during peak periods (May–December).

📤 **Outcome**
This end-to-end project demonstrates real-world business analytics skills in:

Data wrangling (ETL)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data storytelling and dashboard design

It prepares the dataset for use in stakeholder presentations, business intelligence tools, or integration into predictive models and Airbnb profitability calculators.
